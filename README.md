# Swarm Intelligence

Research on Swarm Intelligence algorithms:

- Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO)
- Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO)

## Abstract

Swarm Intelligence (SI), inspired by the collective behaviour of decentralised agents such as ants, birds, and bees, has emerged as a powerful tool for solving complex optimisation problems. This study delves into two prominent SI-based algorithms: **Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO)** and **Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO)**. ACO, modelled after the foraging behaviour of ants, is highly effective in discrete optimisation problems, while PSO, influenced by the social dynamics of bird flocking, excels in continuous optimisation tasks. Both algorithms, however, face challenges such as slow convergence and premature trapping in local optima. The research explores improvements in ACO and PSO through dynamic parameter tuning, hybridisation with other metaheuristics, and adaptive mechanisms to enhance the exploration-exploitation balance. These advancements make SI algorithms more robust, scalable, and suitable for applications across various fields like telecommunications, robotics, and big data analytics. The study also highlights future trends, including hybrid algorithms and scalability improvements, positioning SI as a pivotal methodology in optimisation and automation.

## Introduction

Swarm Intelligence (SI), a concept introduced by Gerardo Beni and Jing Wang in 1989, refers to the collective behaviour observed in decentralised systems, such as insects, robots, or other agents. These agents interact locally with one another and their environment without any centralised control. In optimisation problems, SI models this behaviour by allowing agents to work both independently and collaboratively, using simple rules to solve complex tasks.

This decentralised intelligence is captured by metaheuristic algorithms, capable of handling complex, high-dimensional, and abundant data, making them widely applicable in fields such as data analytics, robotics, and engineering. For instance, ants collectively find the shortest path to food through pheromone trails, illustrating how simple behaviours lead to globally optimal solutions.
